# Jammming

## Description

Jammming is a website that let's the user search spotify for music, add it to a playlist, and then upload the playlist to their spotify account. 

## Usage

To run the app, open the app and run it in the terminal. For Bash, you can do this by using the cd command to change to the project then running "npm start"
This project does require Node Package Manager (npm) to run.

## Technologies
This project uses the Spotify API and the React framework. The languages used are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It was bootstrapped using Create-React-App.

## Contributors
Doug Little contributed as a buddy programmer by reviewing my code during the development process and giving recomendations to improve the app and help in debugging it.
The idea for this project and the name "Jammming" come from Codecademy, but the code is my own. 

## Status
This project is mostly complete but I'm still making some small revisions.
