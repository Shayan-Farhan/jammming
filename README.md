# Jammming

## Description

Jammming is a website that let's the user search spotify for music, add it to a playlist, and then upload the playlist to their spotify account. 

## Usage

Simply visit the website. Currently because the app is under development you will recieve a 401 error unless I have given you permission with the Spotify API. 

## Technologies
This project uses the Spotiyf API and React.js. It was bootstrapped using Create-React-App.

## Contributors
Doug Little contributed by reviewing my code during the development process and either making edits directly or giving me recomendations for me to implement.
The idea for this project and the name "Jammming" come from Codecademy, but the code is my own.
